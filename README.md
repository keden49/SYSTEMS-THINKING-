# SYSTEMS-THINKING-
OVERVIEW 

This is a vibe-coded project , developed as part of my ALX learning Program    
It applies systems thinking to design a platform — an “Uber for Clothes” — that connects local boutique stores to customers through one  imaginary online marketplace. The goal was to build a visualizer ,  to explore how different parts of a system interact and influence one another.  



 What is Systems Thinking?  

Systems thinking is an approach to problem-solving that focuses on the whole system rather than  focusing on isolated parts. Every decision or change in one area creates ripple effects across the entire system. This goes on to show the interdependecies of factors within a system. 

In "Kevin Clothing" I explored how: 

- Local Boutique Owners– often struggle with visibility and access to clients.  
-Local Consumers  – want affordable, convenient fashion.  
-The imaginary website  – acts as the hub that connects supply and demand.  
- Delivery Partners – complete the final piece of the system by delivering the desired goods to the final consumer.  

It also gives a general overview of  the interconnectedness between External Environment systems and internal environment systems.One of the major principles I adopted from my business class in highschool.

 External Environment (EE)  

The external environment affects the whole system and lies outside direct control. For Kevin Clothing, I identified:  

- Economic Conditions → Consumer income, tax rates, inflation affecting purchasing power.  
- Legal Framework → Policies and regulations shaping business operations.  
- Social Framework → Beliefs, attitudes, and cultural norms shaping brand perception.  
-Technology & Trends→ Fashion trends, innovation, and digital adoption influencing competitiveness.  

Example: Low tax rates may increase consumer spending and benefit boutiques, while high inflation reduces affordability and slows the system. All of which are outside the framework of the business. 



 Project Approach  
 
1. Identify the gap → Local boutique stores lacked exposure; customers lacked affordable variety.  
2. Map the system → Outlined all stakeholders and their interactions.  
3. Model the flow → Designed an HTML-coded diagram to represent how goods, payments, and information move.

REFLECTIONS  
This project reflects my passion for systems thinking and how interconnected parts shape outcomes 
Through It, I discovered that systems thinking is a shift in  mindset where we analyze problematic situations from a wider scope of things,as challenges that may seem isolated  maybe more complex than we think,and the only way to find the root cause is through deep analysis into systems . For instance in my case ,if my store is experiencing a low turn over rate , and ive tried all best sale promotions strategies but non is working out ,the best approach to it ,would be shifting my focus from the internal systems and considering my external environment and adjusting my business to meet the current conditions .
